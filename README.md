# Intro
New Dex was planned to be a debugging suite. Only the Explorer part is completed, probably nothing else will be.

It was discontinued more than a year ago, might as well just release.

This is a version of "New Dex" that is lua 5.1 compatible. (got rid of use of continue lol)

## Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deniied0/Dex/master/source.lua')
```
